# Drug Prediction for Patients Using Logistic Regression

Welcome to the Drug Prediction project! In this beginner-level project, we'll explore how to predict suitable patient drugs using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

## Introduction

Predicting suitable drugs for patients is a common task in healthcare, where the goal is to personalize treatment plans based on individual patient characteristics. Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective classification algorithm, can be used for this task by analyzing patient features and predicting the most suitable drug from a set of options.

## Objective

This project aims to build a machine-learning model using Logistic Regression to predict suitable drugs for patients based on their characteristics and medical history. We'll use a small sample of patient data containing features such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels to train and evaluate the model.

## Project Structure

Data: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are provided with step-by-step explanations of data preprocessing, model training, and 
evaluation using Logistic Regression.

Scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

README.md: You're currently reading the README file that provides an overview of the project.

## Conclusion

This beginner-level project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression for predicting suitable drugs for patients based on their characteristics and medical history. By analyzing patient data and training a simple classification model, we aim to provide personalized treatment recommendations to improve patient outcomes.

Happy predicting!
