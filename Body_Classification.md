## Introduction

This project aims to classify people's bodies into different categories using logistic regression, a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm. 

The model predicts body types based on input features such as height, weight, age, and gender.

## Model Architecture

The model employs logistic regression, a binary classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class. 

In this case, the classes represent different body types.

## Objective

This project aims to build a machine-learning model using Logistic Regression to classify bodies based on their characteristics.

We'll use a small sample of patient data containing features such as age, gender and BMI to train and evaluate the model.
