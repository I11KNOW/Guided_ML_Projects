# Machine Maintenance Prediction with Perceptron

Welcome to the Machine Maintenance Prediction project! In this beginner-level task, we'll explore how to predict the maintenance needs of machines using the Perceptron algorithm.

## Introduction

Machine maintenance prediction is a critical task in industries where unplanned downtime can result in significant losses. 

The Perceptron algorithm, a simple yet powerful neural network model, can be used for binary classification tasks like predicting whether a machine requires maintenance or not based on certain features.
