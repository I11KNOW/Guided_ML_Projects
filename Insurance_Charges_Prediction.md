# Insurance Charges Prediction

This project aims to predict the insurance charges for several individuals using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting.

## Overview

Insurance companies often need to estimate charges for individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc. 

Machine learning models can assist in making these predictions accurately, helping the company in risk assessment and pricing strategies.

## Algorithms Used

Random Forest: This algorithm builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions, providing more accurate and stable predictions compared to individual trees.
  
Decision Tree: A simple yet powerful algorithm that creates a tree-like structure of decisions based on features to predict the target variable.
  
Gradient Boosting: This ensemble technique builds trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one, resulting in improved prediction accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models consists of various attributes of individuals such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc., along with their corresponding insurance charges.

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

This beginner-level project demonstrates the use of Decision Tree, Random Forest & Gradient Boosting for predicting suitable charges for people based on their characteristics and active status. 

By analyzing data and training 3 regression models, we aim to provide a suitable metric to know how much charges should be paid by people.

Happy predicting!
