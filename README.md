# Student-Performance
My 4th project was easy alhamdulillah 
But it was a little bit tricky at the end because of the sklearn library 
Which I have never dealt with 
But it was a great one 
I was honored to finish this project under the supervision of IEEE SCU mentors 
Whom I truly see now as my friends
I look forward to other really interesting projects like this
