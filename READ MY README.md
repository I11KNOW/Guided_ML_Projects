# IEEE Linear Regression

Welcome to my first machine-learning project! This project is a simple tutorial aimed at beginners in machine learning, where we use linear regression to predict the performance of a sample of students based on various factors.

# Introduction
In this tutorial project, I had the opportunity to be guided by the organization of IEEE SCU (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Suez Canal University). 

With their guidance, we'll explore the basics of machine learning by building a linear regression model to predict the performance index a student gets based on factors such as previous exam scores, sleep hours, and study hours.

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

# Project Overview

Dataset: We'll use a small synthetic dataset containing information about students' previous exam scores, sleep hours, and study hours, along with the corresponding number of study hours.

Objective: Our goal is to build a linear regression model that can predict the number of study hours a student needs based on the given features.

Tools: We'll be using Python programming language along with popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

# Project Structure.

data: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are provided with step-by-step explanations of the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.
scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: You're currently reading the README file that provides an overview of the project.

# Conclusion
This tutorial project, guided by the organization of IEEE SCU, serves as a gentle introduction to machine learning, specifically linear regression, by predicting study hours based on various factors. 

Feel free to experiment with the dataset, try different features, or explore other machine learning algorithms to further enhance your understanding.

Happy learning!
